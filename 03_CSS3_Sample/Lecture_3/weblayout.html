			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				A jungle is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of jungle are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function.

			<p>
				The Food and Agriculture Organization defines a jungle as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Using this definition FRA 2020 found that jungles covered 4.06 billion hectares or approximately 31 percent of the global land area in 2020.

			As a metaphor, jungle often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be "survival of the fittest". This reflects the view of "city people" that forests are such places. Upton Sinclair gave the title The Jungle (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse. The term "The Law of the Jungle" is also used in a similar context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894)â€”though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos.
